  These components are the simplest AD components to write, since they do not
  require subscriptions* or event handlers. They are simple, basic wrappers to
  put things in--a tool for structuring pages and complex components. Because
  they are so simple, we're combining several of them in a single namespace
  instead of breaking them out into their own packs. Many of these components
  rely on the classes defined in the Bulma CSS library, which are documented
  at https://bulma.io/documentation/layout/.

  *NOTE: For consistency, each of these components supports our standard CSS
  options `:extra-classes` and `subscribe-to-classes`. These can be used to
  attach custom CSS classes to a component when used in the design of larger
  components.
