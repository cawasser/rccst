       "[Clojure](https://clojure.org) is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and
       interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
       [Clojure](https://clojure.org) is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic â€“ every feature supported by
       [Clojure](https://clojure.org) is supported at runtime. [Clojure](https://clojure.org) provides easy access to the Java
       frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

[Clojure](https://clojure.org) is a dialect of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), and shares with
Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system.
[Clojure](https://clojure.org) is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable,
persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive
Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
